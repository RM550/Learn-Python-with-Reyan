# 📜 **README: Python Typing System - Everything You Need to Know**  

## 🔥 **Introduction to Python's Typing System**  

Python is a **dynamically typed** language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime, unlike **statically typed** languages like C, Java, or Rust, where types must be declared explicitly.  

However, Python also supports **type hints (introduced in Python 3.5)**, which allow developers to specify expected data types for better readability, debugging, and IDE support.  

In this guide, we’ll explore:  
✔ **Dynamic Typing in Python**  
✔ **Static Typing (Type Hints) in Python**  
✔ **Duck Typing**  
✔ **Strong vs. Weak Typing**  
✔ **Type Checking & Type Annotations**  

---

## 🏗 **1️⃣ Dynamic Typing in Python**  

Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly—Python infers them at runtime.  

### 📌 **Example: Dynamic Typing in Action**
```python
x = 10       # Integer
x = "hello"  # Now it's a string!
x = [1, 2, 3]  # Now it's a list!
```

💡 **Key Points:**  
✔ The type of `x` changes dynamically based on assignment.  
✔ This makes Python flexible but can lead to unexpected behavior in large projects.  

---

## 🔄 **2️⃣ Static Typing with Type Hints (Type Annotations)**  

Python 3.5 introduced **type hints** (also called **static typing**) using the `typing` module. While Python doesn't enforce them at runtime, they **help developers, IDEs, and linters detect type mismatches**.  

### 📌 **Example: Using Type Hints in Python**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

result = add(10, 5)  # Works fine
result = add("10", 5)  # Type checkers will raise an error
```

💡 **Key Points:**  
✔ **Type hints improve readability** and reduce debugging time.  
✔ Python does not enforce types at runtime—use tools like `mypy` for static checking.  

---

## 🦆 **3️⃣ Duck Typing in Python**  

Python follows the **Duck Typing** principle:  
*"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck!"*  

This means Python cares **more about behavior than explicit types**.  

### 📌 **Example: Duck Typing in Action**
```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

print(animal_sound(Dog()))  # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sound(Cat()))  # Output: Meow!
```

💡 **Key Points:**  
✔ The function `animal_sound()` doesn’t care about the object’s type—only that it has a `speak()` method.  
✔ This makes Python **more flexible** but can lead to **unexpected errors if assumptions are incorrect**.  

---

## ⚡ **4️⃣ Strong vs. Weak Typing in Python**  

Python is a **strongly typed** language, meaning it does **not** perform implicit type conversions that may lead to unexpected results.  

### 📌 **Example: Strong Typing in Action**
```python
print("Age: " + 25)  # ❌ TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

💡 **Key Points:**  
✔ **Python doesn’t allow mixing incompatible types** (e.g., string + int).  
✔ This prevents subtle bugs but requires explicit conversion (`str(25)`).  

---

## 🏗 **5️⃣ The `typing` Module - Advanced Type Hints**  

The `typing` module provides advanced type hints for better type safety.  

### 📌 **1. Basic Type Hints**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def process_data(data: List[int]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    return ("Result", sum(data))

print(process_data([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: ("Result", 6)
```

✔ `List[int]` → A list of integers  
✔ `Tuple[str, int]` → A tuple containing a string and an integer  

---

### 📌 **2. Optional Types (`Optional`)**
```python
from typing import Optional

def greet(name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    if name:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    return "Hello, Stranger!"

print(greet())  # Output: Hello, Stranger!
print(greet("Reyan"))  # Output: Hello, Reyan!
```

✔ `Optional[str]` means the argument can be **either `str` or `None`**.  

---

### 📌 **3. Union Types (`Union`)**
```python
from typing import Union

def square(value: Union[int, float]) -> float:
    return value * value

print(square(5))     # Output: 25
print(square(3.14))  # Output: 9.8596
```

✔ `Union[int, float]` allows **multiple types** as input.  

---

### 📌 **4. Callable Types (`Callable`)**
```python
from typing import Callable

def execute(func: Callable[[int, int], int], x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return func(x, y)

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

print(execute(add, 2, 3))  # Output: 5
```

✔ `Callable[[int, int], int]` means the function should accept **two integers** and return **an integer**.  

---

### 📌 **5. Type Aliases**
```python
from typing import List

Vector = List[float]

def magnitude(v: Vector) -> float:
    return sum(x ** 2 for x in v) ** 0.5

print(magnitude([3.0, 4.0]))  # Output: 5.0
```

✔ `Vector` is an alias for `List[float]`, making the code more readable.  

---

### 📌 **6. Type Variables (`TypeVar`)**
Used for **generic programming**.  

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')  # Define a generic type

def identity(value: T) -> T:
    return value

print(identity(10))     # Output: 10
print(identity("Hello"))  # Output: Hello
```

✔ `TypeVar('T')` allows the function to **work with any data type**.  

---

## 🛠 **6️⃣ Type Checking with `mypy`**  

Python does **not** enforce type hints at runtime, but you can use **`mypy`** for static type checking.  

### 📌 **Install `mypy`**
```sh
pip install mypy
```

### 📌 **Run Type Checking**
```sh
mypy script.py
```

✔ Detects **type errors** before running the program.  

---

## 🏆 **Conclusion**  

Python's **typing system** is flexible, allowing both **dynamic and static typing**:  

✅ **Dynamic Typing** → No need to declare types, determined at runtime  
✅ **Static Typing (Type Hints)** → Improves readability, debugging, and IDE support  
✅ **Duck Typing** → Focuses on behavior instead of explicit types  
✅ **Strong Typing** → Prevents automatic conversions between incompatible types  
✅ **The `typing` module** → Provides advanced type annotations for robust code  

🚀 **Use type hints for better code quality, and `mypy` for catching errors early!** 🐍🔥
