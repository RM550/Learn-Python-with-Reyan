# Understanding Polymorphism in Python 🧑‍💻🐍

**Polymorphism** is one of the core concepts in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It allows you to use a single interface to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and enhancing code reusability.

In this README, we will cover:
- What is **Polymorphism**? 🤔
- Types of **Polymorphism** 🔄
  - **Method Overloading** 🔄
  - **Method Overriding** 🔁
- Examples with detailed explanations and emojis! 🎨

Let’s dive into the world of **Polymorphism**! 🎉

## What is Polymorphism? 🤔

**Polymorphism** means "many forms." In Python, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The most common use of polymorphism is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. 🔄

### Key Points:
- **Polymorphism** allows you to use **methods** or **attributes** in a way that can work across different classes.
- The same method or operation can behave differently based on the object that it is acting on.
- It **enhances code reusability** and **flexibility**. 🔄

## Types of Polymorphism in Python 🔄

There are two main types of **Polymorphism** in Python:

### 1. **Method Overloading** 🔄

**Method Overloading** is a concept where multiple methods with the same name can exist in the same class, but with different numbers or types of arguments. However, Python does not support method overloading directly like other languages. Instead, it uses **default arguments** or **variable-length arguments** to achieve similar functionality. 🎨

### Example 1: Achieving Overloading with Default Arguments 📝

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b=0):  # Default value for b
        return a + b

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(5))  # Output: 5
print(calc.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

In the above example:
- The `add` method has a default value for the second argument, allowing it to be called with either one or two arguments.
- This simulates **method overloading** by using **default arguments**. 🧑‍💻

### 2. **Method Overriding** 🔁

**Method Overriding** occurs when a subclass defines a method that already exists in its parent class. This allows the subclass to provide its own implementation of the method. When the method is called, Python uses the **child class’s version** of the method, not the parent’s. 🔁

### Example 2: Method Overriding in Action 🔄

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks 🐾")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):  # Overriding the speak method
        print("Dog barks 🐕")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):  # Overriding the speak method
        print("Cat meows 🐱")

# Creating objects of Dog and Cat classes
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks 🐕
cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows 🐱
```

In the above example:
- Both `Dog` and `Cat` override the `speak` method that exists in the `Animal` class.
- The **child class methods** are called instead of the **parent class method**, demonstrating **method overriding**. 🔁

## Polymorphism in Action 🔄

Polymorphism allows the use of a **parent class reference** to point to objects of **different child classes**. This makes the code more flexible and reusable. 🎨

### Example 3: Polymorphism with Parent Class Reference 🧑‍💻

```python
class Shape:
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Circle 🟠")

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Square 🟥")

# Using a parent class reference
shapes = [Circle(), Square()]

for shape in shapes:
    shape.draw()
```

Output:
```
Drawing Circle 🟠
Drawing Square 🟥
```

In this example:
- Both `Circle` and `Square` inherit from `Shape`.
- We create a **list of shapes** (with mixed types of `Circle` and `Square`).
- When calling `draw()`, Python uses the correct method based on the object type, showcasing **polymorphism** in action. 🔄

## Benefits of Polymorphism 💡

1. **Code Reusability**: You can use the same method or attribute names across different classes, avoiding redundancy. 🔄
2. **Flexibility**: You can change the behavior of the method for different classes, without modifying the core structure of the class. 🌈
3. **Cleaner Code**: Polymorphism allows for a **cleaner and more maintainable** codebase, as you don’t need to write multiple methods with different names for similar behavior. ✨
4. **Extensibility**: Adding new types of objects is easy — you just create new classes and they will work seamlessly with existing polymorphic code. 🧩
