# 🔄 Mixed Usage Modes in Python

## 🚀 What Are Mixed Usage Modes?
Python scripts can be used in multiple ways, such as running them **directly** or **importing them as modules** in other scripts. When a script is designed to work in both modes, we call this **mixed usage mode**.

This is a powerful concept that makes code **reusable, modular, and maintainable**! 🛠️

## 📌 How Python Handles Script Execution
When a Python script runs, Python assigns a special built-in variable:

```python
__name__
```

🔹 If the script is executed directly, `__name__` is set to:
```python
"__main__"
```
🔹 If the script is imported as a module, `__name__` is set to the module’s name.

This behavior allows developers to control how scripts behave when run in different contexts.

---

## 📜 Implementing Mixed Usage Mode
To create a script that can be **run directly** and **used as a module**, we use:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Code to execute when the script runs directly
```

### ✨ Example: Creating a Mixed Mode Script
```python
# my_script.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! 👋"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("Pythonista"))
```

#### ✅ Running directly:
```sh
$ python my_script.py
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Pythonista! 👋
```

#### ✅ Importing as a module:
```python
import my_script
print(my_script.greet("Alice"))
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice! 👋
```

## 🔍 Why Use Mixed Usage Mode?
✅ **Code Reusability**: Functions can be reused in other scripts/modules.  
✅ **Modularity**: Keeps scripts clean and structured.  
✅ **Testing & Debugging**: Helps test scripts independently before using them as modules.  
✅ **Best Practice**: Encourages writing Pythonic code.  
✅ **Flexibility**: Allows a script to be used in multiple contexts without modification.

## 🏗 Best Practices for Mixed Usage Mode
🔹 **Keep the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block minimal** (call functions instead of writing logic directly).  
🔹 **Use a `main()` function** for better structure.  
🔹 **Avoid hardcoded values**—use arguments where possible.  
🔹 **Log outputs instead of printing** for production-ready scripts.  
🔹 **Write meaningful docstrings** to explain the module’s purpose.  

### 📌 Example with `main()`
```python
# my_script.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! 👋"

def main():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    print(greet(name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This keeps the script **cleaner** and **more maintainable**.

## 🛠️ Advanced Use Cases
### 🏗 Using Argument Parsing
Instead of hardcoding values, we can use `argparse` to pass arguments dynamically:
```python
import argparse

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! 👋"

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Greet a user.")
    parser.add_argument("name", type=str, help="The name of the user")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    print(greet(args.name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
🔹 Run it from the command line:
```sh
$ python my_script.py Alice
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice! 👋
```

### 🌐 Using Logging Instead of Print
For better debugging and logging:
```python
import logging

def greet(name):
    logging.info(f"Generating greeting for {name}")
    return f"Hello, {name}! 👋"

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    print(greet(name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This ensures logs can be captured for debugging in production environments.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
Mixed usage modes in Python are **extremely useful** for writing flexible and reusable scripts. By using the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block properly, you can create scripts that function well both **as standalone programs and as importable modules**! 🎯

By following best practices, implementing argument parsing, and using logging, you can ensure your scripts are not only reusable but also maintainable and scalable.
